# StringCounter
this is my simple string counter project to further improve my C programming skills and implement the things I have learnt as a fresh C learner
This project isn't meant to be a big or amazing project. Just baby steps projects for me to implement the basics I've learned, to test my understanding and hopefully be able to move on to bigger projects very soon :)
